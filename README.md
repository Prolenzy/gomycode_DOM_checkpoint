Project title: A Shopping Cart


(1) To increase the quantity of an item, click on the "+" button.

(2) To decrease the quantity of an item, click on the "-" button.

(3) The value "1" next to the quantity buttons (either the "+" or "-" buttons) represents the default quantity of the item in the shopping cart. When a user views the shopping cart, they see this default quantity value. If they wish to adjust the quantity, they can click the "+" or "-" buttons to increase or decrease the quantity respectively.

(4) Each item row will have a delete option, usually represented by an 'X' icon. Clicking on this will remove the item from the cart.

(5) Each item row will have a heart-shaped button. Clicking on this will toggle the liked state of the item. The heart will change color to indicate if the item is liked or not.

(6) The total price will be dynamically adjusted based on the quantity of each item and any deletions made.
